                            you would like to book an appointment with our psychiatrist or if you need further
                            information about our psychiatry services. There may be exclusions or limitations
                            to your insurance plan. Please call your insurance provider to check if couple therapy
                            is covered under your plan. If it is, please bring a claim form that our clinician will
                            complete after the second or third appointment. We do not provide direct billing;
                            thus, you will be required to pay first and then get reimbursed by your insurance

                  <p class="padding_30">The initial session is referred to as a screening which lasts for 35-45 mins. The clinician
                    uses a play base screening tool to test and gather a history of the presenting concerns
                    and other background information. Following the screening, the clinician will provide
                    feedback and make a recommendation to either start with therapy or an assessment.</p>
                    <p class="padding_30">An assessment takes 2 -4 hours. A report and feedback are provided 7-10 days after
                    the assessment along with a recommended therapy treatment plan.</p>
                    <p class="padding_30"> If therapy is recommended, the clinician will do a dynamic assessment and probe skills
                    over 2 or 3 sessions to determine goals.</p>
                    <p class="padding_30">By the end of the evaluation, the clinician will be able to offer initial impressions of the
                    services required, the treatment plan and provide recommendations on the length and
                    frequency of sessions.</p>
